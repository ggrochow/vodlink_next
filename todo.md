TODO 
- message about submitting streamers to add
- no results text
- check how im using next image with layout and sizes
- fix admin
- channels page
- home page / info page
- can shallow link and loading spinner in results to remove the need for next SSR, probably slower overall
- vodlinkrow - if a match has >1 vods, and a role is selected, make sure streamerRole is selected over first vod found for team1
- move mapvodlink data to serverside
